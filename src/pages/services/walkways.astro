      <div class="faq-list">
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How wide should a concrete walkway be?</h3>
          <p>Residential walkways are typically 3-4 feet wide, while commercial sidewalks may need to be wider to meet accessibility requirements. We'll recommend the appropriate width during your free estimate.</p>
        </div>

          <h3>How long does walkway installation take?</h3>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Do I need a permit for a new walkway?</h3>

        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can walkways be repaired instead of replaced?</h3>

        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Are concrete walkways slippery in winter?</h3>
          <p>We use textured finishes that provide better traction than smooth surfaces. However, all surfaces can be slippery when icy, so proper snow removal is important.</p>
